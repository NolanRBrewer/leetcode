'''
Given ‘M’ sorted arrays, 
find the K’th smallest number among all the arrays.

Example 1:
Input: L1=[2, 6, 8], L2=[3, 6, 7], L3=[1, 3, 4], K=5
Output: 4

Explanation: 
The 5th smallest number among all the arrays is 4, this can be verified from 
the merged list of all the arrays: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8]
