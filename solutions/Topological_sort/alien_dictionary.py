'''
There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language for which we don’t know the ordering 
of the letters. Write a method to find the correct order of the letters in the alien language. 
It is given that the input is a valid dictionary and there exists an ordering among its letters.

Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
Output: bac
Explanation: Given that the words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of the alien language, so
from the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
'''

from collections import deque

  if len(words) == 0:
    return ""

  # a. Initialize the graph
  inDegree = {}  # count of incoming edges
  graph = {}  # adjacency list graph
  for word in words:
    for character in word:
      inDegree[character] = 0 
      graph[character] = [] #what follows every letter

  # b. Build the graph
  for i in range(0, len(words)-1):
    # find ordering of characters from adjacent words
    w1, w2 = words[i], words[i + 1]
    # with how alphabetical order works the max range is defined by the shorter of the two words
    for j in range(0, min(len(w1), len(w2))):
      parent, child = w1[j], w2[j]
      if parent != child:  # if the two characters are different
        # put the child into it's parent's list
        graph[parent].append(child)
        inDegree[child] += 1  # increment child's inDegree
        break  # only the first different character between the two words will help us 
              # find the order

  # c. Find all sources i.e., all vertices with 0 in-degrees
  sources = deque()
